 * Truncate `text` to at most `limit` code points, never cutting inside a

 *
 * `String.prototype.slice` counts UTF-16 code units, so `"ক্ষম".slice(0, 2)`
 * returns `"ক্"` — a consonant followed by a dangling virama, which renders as
 * a broken conjunct and reads as a typo (AUD-G-04). Bengali builds aksharas
 * from base letters, the virama U+09CD and dependent vowel signs, so the cut
 * has to land on a cluster boundary (UAX #29).
 *
 * The budget stays in code points because that is the unit the API counts:
 * `subject_focus` is validated with Python's `len()` as 1-60 characters
 * (`routers/parent.py`), and one cluster is several code points — a 60-cluster
 * result can be three times the accepted length. `Intl.Segmenter` with
 * `granularity: "grapheme"` does the splitting; runtimes without it (older
 * Safari, some WebViews) fall back to code points, which at least never splits
 * a surrogate pair.
